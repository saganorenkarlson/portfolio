                <p>I'm often asked why I chose to study Media Technology, but I am still not entirely sure (I have many theories) so I would rather tell you about why I have enjoyed my studies. 
                    I've always had a fondness for learning, regardless of the subject matter, and what draws me to programming is the combination of continually learning, 
                    recognizing patterns, and problem solving. I also really enjoy being in creative environments, working with creative people and creating things together 
                    with a group. All this I have gotten from MT which is why I hold a bachelor's degree in media technology but as I also wanted to explore more of the worldof technology, 
                    I am currently working towards a master's in computer science.

                    In my studies, I've covered a wide range of topics from AI to machine learning and network security. 
                    I have also gained an interest in software development which I have explored during the summers doing internships and by doing my own projects, 
                    for example this website. Please look around, and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.
